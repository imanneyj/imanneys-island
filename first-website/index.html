        <p> The "Meep" Phenomenon  </p>
        <p>The word "meep" originated as an onomatopoeia for a high-pitched 
        Its popular usage stems primarily from two sources: 
       
        <br> Beaker from The Muppets*: Beaker, the nervous lab 
        assistant,            
        communicates almost entirely through high-pitched "Meep" sounds. His 
        "meeps" are used to express surprise, fear, or sadness. <br> The Road       
        Runner*: The cartoon character's iconic sound is often written as "meep 
        meep," although it is sometimes rendered as "beep beep". <br>
        In modern slang, "meep" has become a versatile interjection used to express 
        a wide range of emotions, including awkwardness, excitement, or a general 
        lack of words.</p>
